What features could we add to this application by leveraging the Gemini API?

Try creating your own 1. AI-Powered Pattern Generation.

Wouldn't allowing users to input their Gemini API Key and using https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro enable them to use the Gemini API?

What would happen if we added a "sparkling" mode feature to this application?

Is it possible to add sound variations to the "sparkling" mode?

Added sound variations to the "sparkling" mode.

Made sound changes in "sparkling" mode more pronounced and added two new synth sounds.
